      <p class="text">Hello and welcome to our site. The goal of our site is to show things that we have done in the past and bring them up to the current standards of our abilities as functioning react applications and display them all in the same place.</p>
      
      <p class="text">We really appreciate the time that you are taking to look at our work, the site includes this page, a page with a list of our applications and then a final page with a link to our own personal portfolios and resumes.</p>

      <p class="text">The apps section will open up in it's own tab, depending on your internet settings it may not go straight to the new tab when it opens, there will also be a section that will explain how each application functions, so please feel free to take a look if it isn't clear how it functions.</p>
